ALGOLIBA

this is a simple library for work with your arrays!

It's provide you an object algo that has some methods to work.
here's a source repository: https://github.com/Mishulka/Algo-lib.git

example:

arr = [2, 4, 23, 5, 7, -10, 1]

console.log(algo.bubbleSort(arr));

//[-10,1,2,4,5,7,23]

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.

Big O Notation	Type	Computations for 10 elements	Computations for 100 elements	Computations for 1000 elements
O(1)	Constant	1	1	1
O(log N)	Logarithmic	3	6	9
O(N)	Linear	10	100	1000
O(N log N)	n log(n)	30	600	9000
O(N^2)	Quadratic	100	10000	1000000
O(2^N)	Exponential	1024	1.26e+29	1.07e+301
O(N!)	Factorial	3628800	9.3e+157	4.02e+2567

Methods for ARRAYS:

bubbleSort()

fastSort()
